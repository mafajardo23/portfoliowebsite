            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Maria Fajardo — born and raised in Colombia and currently studying Computer Science and Digital Studies at Davidson College in North Carolina.</p>
            <p>I’ve always been a curious and creative person. I loved painting and designing. Growing up, I found joy in baking and even turned that passion into a small business. As the business grew, I had a need for a website. This led me to explore the intersection of technology, design, and human behavior.</p>
            <p>Today, I’m passionate about creating digital experiences that are thoughtful, user-centered, and socially aware. Whether I’m designing interfaces, coding a project, or doing user research, I bring both my analytical and creative sides to the table.</p>

            <p>Outside of tech, I still bake (a lot), appreciate a good sunset, and enjoy listening to people’s stories — because I believe the best designs start by paying attention.</p>
